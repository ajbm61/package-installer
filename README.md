## Why?
How do you install a package?

You go to github or packagist or google, search for desired package, see it's full name and available versions, then require it via composer's cli or manually patch `composer.json`, then you search in readme what service providers and facades this package provide and manually copypast them to config. **That's annoying!** Machine must do this.

And here is the solution.

## Installation
1. Require package:
```
composer require terion/package-installer:dev-master
```
2. Add to `app/config/app.php` to `providers` array:
```
'Terion\PackageInstaller\PackageInstallerServiceProvider',
```

## How to use
### 1. Search for a package or install a known one:
```sh
php artisan package:install theme
```
Search for a package on composer. This will output list of found packages with numeric select. **Default selection is the fisrt package in list.**

```sh
php artisan package:install yaap/theme
```
This will install `yaap/theme` package. If there is no such package it will fallback to search.

### 2. Select version
When package selected you will be promted to choose a version from list of availables by number.
```sh
Available versions:
[1] dev-master (2014-06-22 17:54:03)
[2] 1.2.6 (2014-06-22 17:54:03)
[3] 1.2.5 (2014-06-22 17:22:37)
[4] 1.2.4 (2014-05-26 11:16:15)
[5] 1.2.3 (2014-05-25 06:44:39)
[6] 1.2.2 (2014-05-24 22:39:29)
[7] 1.2.1 (2014-05-24 22:36:43)
[8] 1.2.0 (2014-05-24 22:32:40)
[9] 1.1.1 (2014-05-24 18:07:59)
[10] 1.1.0 (2014-05-24 14:28:29)
[11] 1.0.0 (2014-04-27 17:28:38)
Select version by number [2]:
```
**Default selection is the latest stable version if present.** If no stable present â€” then `dev-master` is selected.

### 3. PROFIT!
Installer will now update `composer.json`, install the package, search for ServiceProviders and Facades and patch `app/config/app.php`. It also respects [Ryan's](https://github.com/rtablada) [package installer](https://github.com/rtablada/package-installer) `provides.json` but still will make the work without it.
